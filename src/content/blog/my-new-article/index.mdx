# Getting Started with Astro: A Modern Web Framework

Astro is a modern web framework that allows you to build fast, content-focused websites with your favorite UI components and styling. In this guide, we'll explore the key features that make Astro stand out in the crowded web framework landscape.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a web framework for building content-rich websites. It's designed to be fast by default, with a focus on static site generation and minimal JavaScript. Unlike traditional frameworks that ship JavaScript to the browser, Astro only sends JavaScript when you explicitly opt-in.

## Key Features

### 1. **Zero JavaScript by Default**
Astro components render to HTML at build time, resulting in faster page loads and better performance. JavaScript is only included when you explicitly add it.

### 2. **Component Islands**
You can use any UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) as "islands" within your Astro pages. This gives you the flexibility to choose the right tool for each component.

### 3. **Built-in Optimizations**
Astro includes automatic image optimization, CSS optimization, and asset bundling out of the box.

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-astro-site
cd my-astro-site
npm install
```

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project includes:

- `src/pages/` - Your pages and routes
- `src/components/` - Reusable components
- `src/layouts/` - Page layouts
- `public/` - Static assets

## Creating Your First Page

Create a new file at `src/pages/index.astro`:

```astro
---
// Frontmatter goes here
const title = "Welcome to Astro";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>This is your first Astro page!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro is perfect for:

- **Content websites** - Blogs, documentation, marketing sites
- **E-commerce** - Product catalogs and landing pages
- **Portfolios** - Showcase your work with fast loading times
- **Corporate sites** - Professional websites with excellent SEO

## Conclusion

Astro represents a new approach to web development, prioritizing performance and developer experience. Its component-based architecture and static-first approach make it an excellent choice for modern web projects.

Whether you're building a personal blog or a large-scale content site, Astro provides the tools and performance you need to succeed in today's web landscape.
